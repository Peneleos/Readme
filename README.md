All work produced on my profile will mainly be work in progress, as I plan on getting better working in multiple coding languages. </br>
Current languages that I have a basic knowledge of how to code in are: </br>
PHP </br>
Java </br>
Javascript </br>
Html </br>
C++ </br>
</br>
For anyone looking at my code, it isn't perfect and properly will never be completely finished </br>
as I learn new skills in this growing industry. </br>
Any feedback will be gladly accepted whether it is positive or not, as this will help me develop into a better coder. </br>
